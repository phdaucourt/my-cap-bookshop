# My Bookshop (SAP CAP)

Here are my first steps to learn SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP).

This project is my own implementation of the ["Getting Started in a Nutshell"](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/get-started/in-a-nutshell) tutorial from [official CAP documentation](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/).
